"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for High Cholesterol 							""I have been on Lipitor for 6 months. My cholesterol went down from 220 to 156, I was tested 2 months ago, therefore I hope it is going down. Fortunately, I don't have any side effect, Thank goodness."""
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease 							""I used Zocor for first statin follin angioplasty December 2009. I must state that I have a high degree of sensitivity to medications and high degree of allergies. With Zocor, I experienced abdominal cramps increasing daily, muscle pain and off and on nausea. The cramps were a concern because I have experienced anemia in the past. My doctor, whom I trust with my life, suggested that I not take Zocor. After several months I had blood work, my LDH still higher than doctor wanted, so he prescribed Lipitor. I had same bad effects, but on a higher level. Fortunately, my doctor trusts my reports. There is one ""weird"" change that I have not shared with my doctor, but I am sharing with all of you. In several days, and increasingly, I am losing hair. Help me!"""
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for High Cholesterol 							""I had extremely high hopes for this cholesterol buster and had the best attitude and hopes for this medication but definitely did not work out.  My cholesterol level was 225 and my left carotid artery via a Doppler was 50-70 percent narrowed.  Changed my diet immediately, started exercising, put plans in play to stop smoking and in thinking with Lipitor I'd give myself the best possible chance to reverse the plaque.  Doctor prescribed 10mg, was only able to tolerate it a week.  The first 4 days, no side effects, excited as heck, the 5th day off and on I started experiencing a twighlight zone brain fog that would last 10-15 minutes.  Felt like a couldn't clinch a thought, felt foggy, happened 2x the 5th day, 4x the 6th day, no more......"""

"For High Cholesterol 							""They put me on 80mg it's been a year now  my stomach been bad. Keep looking for a toilet feeling bloated it didn't give me pains in my arms or legs. Today I thought after being on them a year and been to the toilet like 100 times let me check the reviews on my tablets to see what is causing me these problems then I came across your review letting me understand these tablet are causing me IBF."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""I took both simvastatin (got a rash/hives) and Lipitor (even worse rash/hives) which I'm still plagued by even though I went off Lipitor more than a month ago. The rash comes and goes; some days unbearable and others barely noticeable. My urine also developed a foul and toxic odor along with changes in urinary habits/timing."
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for High Cholesterol 							""Previous experience with other statins and the fact that I have fibromyalgia pain on a regular basis should have been a red flag but wasn't.  It took 2 years to realize the tailbone pain and rectal bleeding were caused by lipitor,  but the light bulb finally lit, I went off lipitor,  symptoms subsided.  I even had a perfect colonoscopy while bleeding.  No more statins for me."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""Switched from Lovastatin to Atorvastatin with Gemfibrozil, resulting in much better numbers and no side effects."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""I'm leaving a positive review because I want others to know that statins don't always have bad side effects. I've been on atorvastatin for about 3 months now. I never got the muscle aches or any other side effects. I do take CoQ10 since this is the supplement that is recommended to combat muscle aches. The best thing is, my cholesterol went down and my doctor is pleased."""

"For High Cholesterol 							""I started taking Atorvastatin 20mg daily about 2-3 months ago, and started having weird side effects.   I noticed both legs, from the knee down, started having some pain and swelling.  The swelling was the worse.  The pain would have been bearable if that had been the only problem.   Another side effect was some nausea, and the ACID REFLUX, was worse than I had ever had since my initial diagnosis 30 years ago."
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for High Cholesterol 							""I took  40mgs. Lipitor daily for 2 weeks & experienced complete muscle paralysis in my legs & arms.  Had to stop taking Lipitor.  Next Dr  prescribed Crestor. Crestor worked alright for 1 month. Then again I had paralysis in my arms & legs. The paralysis disappeared in several days after stopping the  cholesterol lowering meds. Dr. Then prescribed Niaspan (prescription strength  Niacin) that also produced the paralysis in my thighs and arms , within 2 weeks . Paralysis disappeared in 2 to 3 days after stopping each med. Dr. Decided I need to take 500 mgs. Niacin with food 4 times per day  & that has helped me greatly,  w/o any paralysis. I also decreased  foods that are high in cholesterol & exercise  more often.  I  am 72 yrs of age."""
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease 							""My experience with this drug was not very good. I was prescribed 10 mg 1 tablet to be taken per day. I was healthy with normal blood pressure and walked and exercised probably 4 miles per day and was generally fit and healthy. I was unable to take the tablet every day and ended up having to skip days because of the side effects. On day 3 it gave me a dizzy feeling and a sense of anger like wanting to snap at someone for no reason. Day 4 was a spacey feeling like floating and generally feeling like no desire to want to do anything. Went out for a walk got the most terrible muscle cramps in the calves which came and went. Also a panic anxiety feeling that lasted about a minute which felt like I was going to die and a general feeling of not being well. Then the doctor said take it every other day and this was causing me insomnia where I would sleep for a hour then be awake for 4 hours trying to sleep . Also very low sex drive and a feeling like I was being poisoned. Eventually came off it"""
"For High Cholesterol 							""My doctor recently put me on Lorstat 10 (10mg) because my triglyceride levels were high, but overall ratings were good. I thought I was doing fine on them, but have been drinking a lot more water & going to the toilet for wee's a lot more, waking in the middle of the night & not being able to get back to sleep quickly, had also been suffering a runny nose for no reason & sometimes sore throat & then the last couple of weeks it feels like I have something stuck in my throat (the feeling of having a tablet or something stuck). After doing some research, I have since found out that these can all be side effects of atorvastatins...I took my last tablet 3 days ago. My runny nose etc has gotten a lot better, I still have the sensation of something being stuck in my throat...Has anyone else had this & how long did it take to go away? I'm going to make an appointment with my son's dietitian to help lower my cholesterol..."""
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for High Cholesterol 							""I had tried about 3 statins and could not take  them due to the aches and energy loss. I them was given lipitor. I took it for 3 months with no problem, then I start having memory loss. I stopped the drug and that had now been about 2 years. The loss is better but still comes and goes."
"For High Cholesterol 							""Have been taking lipitor for for 2 months. Went to Dr for yearly check up and blood work. My white blood count was low at 2.8 the only changes I have made since last check up is the addition of lipitor and Keto diet. The last 2 weeks I have been dizzy and have headaches and insomnia. Not sure if I should quit taking the drug or quit my diet."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""No doubt Lipitor at any dose does lowers your numbers. But what does that really mean, has plaque in your arteries reduced by same percentage ? I think not. Still statins might have their place but who can tolerate them, very few if you research. I just wish the doctors would push and insist on diet/exercise plans before prescribing statins. Was on Liptor only 10 mg for 18 months, numbers down but felt like crap. The usual intense body muscle aches. Off for a week now and my body is telling me already it needs a break from statin drugs. I'm totally satisfied to move forward and roll dice with diet/exercise. Doctor is in full agreement to drop statin for now. 66 year old male and still very active despite some heart failure."""

I've been put on several different kinds of meds for high cholesterol and they all have side effects that I can't deal with. It's sad but every Dr I've had has wanted to put me on these meds that make me sick. I'm gonna find foods that may help"""
"Lipitor (atorvastatin) for High Cholesterol 							""I was taking the combination drug Caduet, of which Lipitor was one of the two drugs. Steadily over a year my doctor increased the medication from 20mg to 40mg, and then about three months ago he increased it to 80mg. Within a month I was experienceing severe tiredness, and eventually sever muscle weakness, coupled with elevated CK readings. On doing some research on the drug I found that the symptoms I had were indeed a major drug reaction. Although Lipitor helped in the reduction of my cholesterol levels, the side effects were debilitating. Within a week of having the medication changed to a non-statin I was beginning to feel better. A month later I am close to being back to my old self. There are other better alternatives."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""I have experienced severe heartburn since increased dosage from 40to 80 mg."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""I was given Atorvastatin by my cardiologist one month ago. The first 10 days I only felt a bit tired in the evening. Then after 10 days I started experiencing stomach problem, felt bloathed all the time, gas in my belly, even though I don't eat anything that could cause it. I went to the ER twice because of the pressure I felt on my organs. I am not sure 100% yet but I think its the medicine. I stopped taking it, even though my doctor does not agree, because I want to see if I return the way I was before. I am feeling so sick all the time and before taking this medicine, I have never been to an ER and was never ill..."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""Had by pass surgery, six of them, and was put on an 80MG dose of atorvastatin. Before surgery my LDL was 114, total was 214, HDL was 82 and triglyceride was 88. After one week on an 80 mg dose my values were 73, 166, 80 and 65. I was pleased and no side effects. Then after 5 months I began getting itching on my back and arms that drove me batty. My memory seemed to be suffering. The final straw was a complete loss of strength in my left leg, near the calf muscle. I could not even walk up my stairs. I immediately stopped taking atorvastatin and within two days the muscle returned to normal and the itching got way less severe. Memory also improved. I am 77 years old and have always been a runner so am in very good shape."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""Amazing results! My doctor and I are thrilled. 6 months ago, my total cholesterol was still hovering just north of 300. Today it is 165. Over 100 points cut from my LDL, and Trigs (Lovaza alone got these down from 400 to 250) went down a good bit too. All lipids are in the normal range for the first time in my adult life.

I have heaviness and weakness in my legs, hard to walk far. Sleep problems, walking and talking while asleep, seizures Lasting a few seconds. this week other joints started hurting as well.  Hey the good news is, My cholesterol went way down. I quit taking this med yesterday. Lowering my cholesterol is not worth all the side affects.   I am glad it works for some, but have researched this drug and so many have had a bad reaction."""

I was treated for asthma and allergies with no relief. I researched this medicine and had all the side effects. This week I stopped taking it and all asthma treatments. After 5 days I'm breathing much better and not using inhaler or breathing treatments. I sleep through the night without gasping and coughing.

Pyronnies, constipation, arthritis, short term memory loss, could not lift my arms above my head and horrible fatigue."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""Went on atorvastatin because I had a fully blocked vertebral artery in the back of my neck and a partially blocked vertebral artery that required a stent. Within three days, I started getting a flushing of the skin of face and neck. Then the muscle soreness kicked in along with stiffness in other muscles. This gradually increased into neck muscles and finger muscles. I also developed weakness in all extremities. I was also in a fog at times and it was difficult to concentrate at work. I also had trouble focusing my vision. All of this happened over the six weeks that I was taking the drug. Have to be on something to lower cholesterol until stent is placed so doctor put me on another statin. However, I believe in quality of life over quantity of life so if the new statin continues like the old one, I will stop taking them and switch to berberine, which the scientific studies I have seen show to be just as effective at reducing cholesterol. My doctor is okay with this plan."""

My side effects (in no particular order): muscle cramps/pain/weakness/swelling/tightness, tiredness, diarrhea/intestinal cramping, increased ringing in the ears, and depression/angry mood swings. 3 days without med- pain, etc continues to improve."""
"For High Cholesterol 							""I have been on Atorvastatin  for about three months . I kept telling my doctor that my legs hurt. So she ordered a EMG [Electromyography measures muscle response]  which I refused.  She’s trying to make it sound like I’m crazy and it’s all in my head that my legs hurt or that there something else wrong when in fact it’s from the atorvastatin . I’m sorry to say this but I think doctors are all about the money because if she would’ve told me the side effects of this drug I wouldn’t of taken it in the first place.

Feeling drained to the core and having no energy. This poison has me pretty much unable to function. When in the ER, the doctor told me that this medication causes muscular pain and people end up stopping taking it. Add me to that list. I have an appointment with my doctor next week and will inform him the side effects are too devastating to continue taking it. This is no way to live when people have to help you walk across the street as if you're over 100 years old.  Tonight, I am DONE taking it. Then, reading through various complaints there are people ultimately being diagnosed with Parkinson's and doctors are still prescribing it.

So went to the emegency dept at local hospital. Nothing much was done there. My wife told me that my skin colour was strange and yellowish. When discharged, because of the coincidence between feeling unwell and change in medication, and as I could not see a doctor straight away I took myself off the new meds and reverted back to the old one and went to see a dr the next day.

I had to walk with crutches for a week and after weeks still having trouble. I read an article that said 1 in 4 Americans take statins. However because the “normal” cholesterol numbers are being lowered which means more people will be diagnosed with high cholesterol that statistic is going to change to 1 in 2 Americans.
