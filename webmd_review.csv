"I was diagnosed with high cholesterol, HDL low, LDH? Day 1-100 days: 1 grapefruit/day , exercise (run for 30 minutes=2 miles) & low carbohydrate diet (180 gms/day). Fasting blood test showed Increase HDL by 2.5%, still high cholesterol at 260s.  Day 101: 5 mg/day for one day has caused extreme lightheadedness, tiredness. Stop. Doesn't feel right for my body. Looking for options."
"No issue so far. I don't have high cholesterol and don't know how my levels have changed, but I don't have any other issues so far."
"I started taking this drug 3 weeks ago and right away I started having bad dreams, stiff neck, muscle weakness and pain in my legs,arms and head. Gave it up 3 days ago, now things are back to normal. This stuff is Bad News!"
"While this medicine lowered my total cholesterol to 164 from 244, it caused side effects.  I experienced persistent, intolerable muscle pain & weakness in both upper arms and debilitating hip pain.  7 days after stopping it, my arms are much better, hip pain is gone, and it feels like a cloud of fog has been lifted from me.  I feel great!  It's hard to believe that only 5 mg. per day of Atorvastatin could make me feel so rotten.  Glad I was proactive with my doctor and finally got off of that poison.Read More Read Less"
"Atorvastatin has caused inflamation to the bilial (bile) area of the liver.  I was taken completely off this med.  When I was taking simvastatin, there was no a problem. The cardiologist said simvastatin had to be changed because of a directive.  I have a pigs valve (replacement).  Just spent 5 days in hospital because of inflamation around liver area due to atorvastatin."
"In 1 month after my Dr switched me over from using lovastatin, it lowered both C & T a lot more than the previous above. She was very pleased."
"after 4 nights of nightmares,legs pain, trouble swallowing,headache,neck pain,back pain and on day 5 hives.dr tells me they cant be from this med but I KNOW BETTER i never had nightmares before,and the stomach pain and weekness and confusion dizziness didnt start till i took this med i notice im not the only one having trouble with this med..im wondering if the name brand is the same or just some of the fillers in this one,stopped taking it,i need help to lower my numbers but this drug isnt it,dr wants me to stop it wait a week and try it again IS HE NUTZ??????Read More Read Less"
"After 8 years I developed severe muscle reaction to Crestor 20mg. No statins for six months. Total cholesterol = 271, LDL=178, Triglycerides = 193  i.e. worse than pre-Crestor levels. Started atorvistatin 20mg. After 3 months: Total chol. = 154, LDL =73 and trigl = 134 with no discernable side effects. Diet and exercise levels unchanged. It seems to be working."
"My ankles,feet and legs after 1 week are swollen"
"I started with shooting pain in my right eye, then stomach pains and finally the neck pain was so bad I stopped leaving 4 pills out of a the 30 supplied.  This me medication did not like me!!"

"Scary stuff..as soon as I started taking it, muscle cramps so severe cannot put in a nite of good sleep,  Also, dizziness is noticed and swallowing is more difficult.  Called doc's office to report..don't want to take it anymore..I need my sleep, yet I need to get my blood reading down.   Am in good shape, exercise and eat well."
"I am a cardiac patient, with high level of triglycerides in my blood."
"Take 60 mg daily. Has lowered cholesterol levels significantly. Have some problems with leg and muscle cramps.  Take 300 mg of CQ10 and it has lessened the frequency of cramping.  In general, the drug works."
"Side effects worse than any benefits and, no,  media reports haven't influenced my decision to stop taking Lipitor. Lowering cholesterol is no benefit when I am nauseous and faecally incontinent to the point I fear any outdoor activity. None of this after 2 weeks abstaining from Lipitor. I have no doubts this medication is the right one for many--but not for me-and I haven't consulted my GP yet"
"Yes, it dramatically reduced the numbers for my bad cholesterol, HOWEVER...after a year of usage I was having mental confusion in mornings, pale stools, constipation and extreme tiredness.  My Dr. discarded any of these symptoms as related to Lipitor(atorvastatin).  However, when I spoke with someone else , having same symptoms, I stopped the drug.  Within 3 months, all is back to normal. Haven't had blood work yet. Very disturbing!"
"I have been taking atorvastatin (Lipitor) for several years now, and have had no problems at all.  My cholesterol has stayed low the entire time I have been taking this medication."
"I am experiencing muscle spasm, hands shaking or tremor in both hands., tiredness. My Doctor  is referring me to a neurologist."

"I have been taking this medication for 4 months, it has lowered my numbers. I am having problems with urination,and am getting a rash from the urine, it is very strong and not much fluid, also I am very tired and am having back pain and leg cramps, the pain has just started a few days ago.

"I'm a heart patient and undergone angioplasty thrice. As advice by my doctor, I'm taking this drug regularly and now my cholestorol level comes down to normal."
"After taking Lipitor for 3 years I developed severe muscle pain in my shoulders, upper arms and legs. It has been 6 months since I stopped taking Lipitor and I still have muscle pain though the severity has lessened.  Pain medication is still required to function normally."
"I took 80mg Lipitor once a day for 6 months and then the doctor reduced it to 40mg.  At around 4 month into taking Lipitor muscle pain developed in my calves.  It is difficult to go down stairs, and my calves ache most of the time.  A month ago, started taking 300mg CoQ10 daily (after reading that it is a good supplement for people to take who experience muscle pain from statin drugs) and the muscle pain is less than it was but still uncomfortable at times.

"After 2 heart attacks and 1.5 years I was fine taking 20mg/day. This drug was not effective until I started taking it at night (173). Then after 1.5 years I started to experience chest aches, leg/joint aches, and jaw pain. I quit and felt better afterward but my cholesterol raised back up to 240. I still have jaw pain."

Good.
"As a type 2 diabetic (controlled with no meds), I took a 10mg dose for 6 days with my evening meal. While sleeping on the 4th night I had rapid heart beat, chest tightness, numbness in both hands, leg pain, ringing in my ears and head pressure. Went to my internist the next morning; he prescribed an echo stress test - normal results. On the 5th night - same symptoms only worse; felt like I was CRASHING. Went to internist again; did a 24 hour holter heart test. I noticed that I felt better as the day progressed and looked at the pill I was about to take;then to the internet and decided to discontinue use. The two incidents happened about the same time - 3:30-4:00am. It was an amazing improvement the next morning without the pill, all symptoms were gone except for the numbness in fingers. Again, as the day progressed, I'm feeling like a totally different person. This is just a warning to all, and especially diabetics, that statins can have severe reactions. Trust your gut! Difficult as it is, diet and exercise are still the best medicine if possible.           Read More Read Less"

"I have no proof but, I believe I was suffering some memory loss with the 80MG dose.  I reduced the dose to 40MG, over my MD's objection, and I think I do better in the memory department. I'm sure some memory lost is due to lack of paying attention. My cholesterol is continuing to be reduce to acceptable levels at the lower Atorvastatin dose."
High cholesterol and high triglycerides. Both have been reduced to acceptable (normal) levels. 40 mg per day after 6 months treatment

"I had aortic valve replacement in February and my cardiologist wanted my cholesterol level to be lower.  I developed horrendous leg and foot cramps at night, and was also having ocular auras every day, sometimes twice or three times.  I did have these on occasion in the past, but not to this extent.  I began taking COQ10, but it didn't help.  Then I reduced my dosage from 20 mg to 10 and have been off it for a little over a week.  No leg or foot cramps and no ocular auras since."

"I've been taking this medication for about a month. Reference to reading the reviews, I must say that it works wonders. I was always tired before taking this med, but it makes me feel great. Another strange thing is that I had spider veins on both legs above the knee area, and they are disappearing fast. I can't wait until my next check up to see if it doing what it should."
"Although it reduces my cholesterol, my doctor has asked me to take it at night time with my other medications. It is the only different medication I take than what I take in the morning. So when I take it at night time I get the leg jerks. It's a funny feeling in my leg and I feel the need to jerk my leg to get rid of the feeling. And it will continue throughout the night. It's very annoying and aggravating."

I have never been prescribed a drug that made me feel so bad, in so many different ways. Extreme muscle pain, mostly in the legs, malaise, lack of energy, lack of motivation, mental fuzziness, sleep issues. How can a prescription be effective when it removes all motivation by making you feel bad? Do not understand why Drs are so quick to put patients on drugs when they know how many side effects there are. I was not really warned about all these issues but when I started experiencing them it only took a few seconds to find out how many other people have had major problems with this stuff.

"My doctor wanted me to take 10 mg of atorvastatin in stead of the 10 mg of simvistatin that I've been taking for years to lower my cholesterol.  I've been taking it now for  3 or 4 weeks.  I've been experiencing leg cramps at night, and swollen ankles all day long.  Prior to taken this drug, I had notice some ankle swelling at night only.  Now my ankles are always swollen.  I've also notice feelings of impatience, anxiety and memory impairment.  A few days ago while attending an charity function, thirty mintues into the program I began to perspire profusely, stomach upset and extreme dizzyness.  I thought I was having a heart attach.  The attendants called 911, they took my blood pressure and it was extremely high.  They had me stand up and the BP dropped to 81/40.  Never experience this before.  ER   ran tests:  EKG, blood work, chest Xray, urine...everything came back normal.  What in the heck was that all about?  Dehydration??  Heat stroke, or the new statin meds? Read More Read Less"

"My wife took atorvastatin for two years, and stopped about two months ago due to muscle pain in her knees. Perhaps coincidentally, she had developed an increasing sensitivity to gluten which gave her consistent stomach problems whenever she ate a gluten-containing product. Since she stopped taking the atorvastatin (with no other changes to her medicines or diet), she can now eat gluten. This change was gradual, suggesting a direct relation to the gradual elimination of statin remnants in her system.Read More Read Less"

After reading some of these reviews I believe it was just side effect from this medication. I have also had cramps along with diarrhea since day one to.

Take Statins for 20 years now.  Lipitor is the most effective for my metabolism.  I take it earlier in the day.  Somehow the Statin increases my metabolism and subsequently hinders sleep when I take at bedtime.  No problems when taken earlier in the day.

I take 40mg atorvastatin. Started with Lipitor in 2008 prescribed by Heart doctor since I have had 3 procedures for stents to unblock arteries. He switched me to atorvastatin a couple of years ago. Leg cramps at night most serious side effects. Total Chol is 169 HDL -51 LDL - 105. Last 9 months PCP put me on 500 mg metformin 2 times a day for type 2 diabetes. End of Sept/14 doubled metformin since AIC was 8.4. Had severe uncontrollable diarrhea and gas. Stopped the extra dose and now he added 5mg glipizide divided am  and pm to the metformin. I read that statins can cause type 2 diabetes and did not have it until 2 years ago. I am going to concentrate on losing weight and adding more exercise to see if I can eventually get off these drugs or at least reduce the dosage. I feel all these meds are working against each other.

"Was on the generic atorvastatin took myself off of it, after having extreme joint pain, chest pain, neck pain for three years. Have been on statins for over 15 years with general pain and joint pain. All my pain issues went away seems I'm not older like my doctors seem to want to defer to or doing work that I'm not used to, like my doctors say. Right now I am pissed off because it seems my complaints over the years have been defaulted to thinking I am wrong about my pain. It was after talking to a neighbor about my knee pain that he told me that statins were shutting down his liver, he went on to tell me about lower chronic back pain and leg pain which I also had.   I had a heart attack three years ago and had a stent put in and my level of statins upped from 20mg to 80mg which is when I really started to have constant chronic pain. You need to be your own watch dog on the medications your doctors give you, because they won't tell you it is the meds doing it to you. The AMA tells them its OK and that ruling is the bible to doctors. Since being off of statins for over a month I feel like I have gone back in time 20 years, I don't have pain I have soreness when I work which is normal. I have more energy, I don't have the stiff neck I have had for over three years, I don't have the tight chest like I've had. I do have less respect for people I thought were working with me only to find out they want me back on the statins. High cholesterol runs in my family my mother died at 86 after falling and going into a coma, not because of her high cholesterol. What I am trying to say is you know your self better then anyone be your own advocate. Trust that most doctors are going to do what the AMA tells them to do, not what is best for you.

I stuck in there to see if I could get over the terrible side effects of terrible pain in my right arm to my elbow and terrible pain in all my joints.  My cholesterol went down dramatically.  Tried a different statin with little muscle pain but also no significant lowering of my cholesterol.  Atorvastatin is like poison to my body.  I will try another statin.  Some people can take it with little pain, I thought I was going to die."
works great  in reducing bad cholestorol..
"I have been taking 40 mg of Atorvastatin for 5 months now and it has reduced my total Cholesterol levels from 340 to 145, and has reduced my Triglycerides to 113.

"As with any medication a physical and/or mental reaction is always possible, but this medication has worked very well for me.  It has lowered my cholesterol and now if I can just get my blood pressure under control.  I had no bad reaction with this medication but I do have anxiety issues once in a while.  So I must realize when it is a panic attack, or an anxiety issue and not the medication.  It is way too easy for me to focus on the oh no, issues.  Mostly when it is a new medication, and believe me I have been on a few in my life time.  But this medication seems to be ok, but I would always ask the physician to start me out on the smallest dosage possible, and try to know the difference between the effect of the medication and my anxiety issue.

I feel pretty good, it has only been 2 weeks so we will see what happens over 3 months."
its a helpful drug.after few hrs. you feel normal.
"I started taking this medication going on 3mths with a BP medication, I took it for a month and I started having severe muscle spasms especially down my left leg. I called my Dr.'s office spoke with my Dr. he told me to stop taking it, I had stopped a week prior because the pain is unbearable, it is going on almost 3mths since I stopped taking this medication and my symptoms seem to be getting worse, I can't sleep, walk, stand, or even sit for long periods of time. I use Icy Hot, Blue Emu, Capsazine, etc. etc. to rub into my muscles to ease the pain, nothing works. I used to teach salsa classes, I danced regularly, I played with my grandchildren and now I do none of the above. I cannot tolerate this pain anymore, I want my legs back, this is destroying my personal life. I was not told that this medication could ruin my everyday life. Stay away from it.Read More Read Less"
"I was very lethargic and had bad lower back pain which I still have. I didn't feel like doing anything, total lack of motivation. I took for around 3 months until I realized this is what was causing all my problems.  I felt so bad I thought my cancer was back. I've been off for around 3 weeks. I'm having more energy but my back still hurts with a few other side effects."
"I didn't know why they had prescribed this drug for me. I ran across some info about it on the internet that made want to look at the side affects. I had a lot of them. The main ones were achy muscles and joints,Blurry vision, and I just couldn't function. I quit taking it and I feel much more alive after open heart surgery. I asked the doctors why I'm taking it and they said it was to prevent another heart attach. There were several problems in my life which led to my surgery. I know high cholesterol wasn't one of them. This drug is also known as Lipitor.Read More Read Less"
It lowered my cholesterol almost 100 points in 3 months but I started having severe leg aches and back pain plus extreme fatigue. I had no motivation to do anything. I stopped taking the drug and within a couple days my leg pain decreased 90% and I now have a lot more energy.
"As far as lowering bad cholesterol levels and triglycerides this worked. The side effects for me included a rise in blood sugar (A1C), itch/rash, and ED. I had tried to stop the medication for a couple of weeks and I was feeling fine but then noticed the heavy breathing coming back with being light headed and dizzy. I have been on Lipitor for over 10 years."
I took 40mg for a year and a half.I stopped when I started falling because of week legs.I became so weak that I now can only walk with a walker.I bought an elect. scooter which I use now.I have been to many doctors with no help.I  think I need a good lawyer.
It brought all my bad readings down but caused severe UTI.  The pain stopped in one day when I stopped taking it.  This was all confirmed by my urologist.
"Traditionally have 280-ish cholesterol with plenty of bad cholesterol.  Atorvastatin brings it down to below 180 within about a month.  If I stop taking it for a few weeks, the number shoots back up.  Good cholesterol also improves with the medicine."
Lowered my cholesterol to safe levels but it seems to cause problems with mental clarity. I have problems with my concentration. Has had no effect on triglycerides.
"I'm 3 months in. Was blood tested for a different doctor 2 weeks after starting it and my LDL had dropped a dramatic amount already. Blood test last week had my LDL in healthy levels, triglycerides in healthy levels, and HDL was still okay.    No side effects noticed."
"This drug lowered my cholesterol by almost 75 points and my high cholesterol remained good.  Only on 10mg.  However,  I get a buzzing in my head and am wondering if it is this medication.  Anyone else have this sensation?"
I had been taking this medication for at least 2 years.  I have lost 42 pounds and that is when my pain in my knees and thighs became severe.  Dr. took me off this med and has made a large improvement in pain level.  Much better.
"It did lower my high bad cholesterol, but also lowered my good cholesterol and that's NOT good, and had a lot of chest pain on 20mg, so went down to 10 mg and it got rid of chest pain, but I know a lot of weight gain since taking it. Does anybody retained a lot of fluid on it?"
I have been through a few high cholesterol medications through the years.  I have had high cholesterol since I was 18 yrs old (thanks Dad). I have been on Atorvastatin since 2008 and it was worked wonderfully for me.  No side effects and hoping it will stay that way.
"I've been taking 40mg daily, with no problems.  Cholesterol is falling like a rock.  I also have high blood pressure with reading all over the charts.  Now, my readings have stabilized. I've also noticed the color of my blood is now a nice bright red, rather the reddish-brownish color it was before.  Also, my heart rate has fallen for the low high 70's - 80's to the low to mid 60's.  I exercise on a stair step machine 25 minutes, twice daily, and have included more salads and other greens into my diet.  Overall, I am feeling much better, and friends have said I look a lot healther than before.Read More Read Less"
Had extreme pain with muscle cramping and it affected my head with inability to think clearly or communicate and it was stopped after taking 1 pill.
My experience with this drug is that it has help my cholesterol and have no side effects.
doctor prescribed medication without informing me of reason for medication and  required dietary restrictions (grapefruit). I experienced extreme anxiety and confusion. I stopped the medication and seeking a new primary care doctor.
Name the side effect and I got it. Side effects began on 2nd day. I don't understand with so many drugs for lowering cholesterol why any doctor would prescribe this one. Would never take again.
I was hesitant at first but unlike others I started with bad knees and it was like a complete reversal of years of swelling vanished over the first 3 months. My doctor was surprised and thought it might be a combination of nasid I have been taking and this. Stopped taking the 20mg Atorvastatin for a month and the swelling started to return. Went back on and it's gone. I would love to know if others have found similar results or if maybe its just the Tampa humidity.
"Started taking this medicine about 10 days ago. At first I had a little muscle pain, but that is now gone. Also had a mild headache for a few days, but that too is gone. I seem to be actually sleeping a little better. I won't know if this stuff is helping for a couple months until my follow up appointment. I'm not sure if I would take this medication after reading some of these reviews. I'll just have to cross my fingers......."
"Have been taking this in a low dose for 2 years. Last 2 months I have had brain fog, difficulty concentrating and lots of joint pain in hips, elbows and knees. went to doctor andam being takenoff drug for4 weeks"
"I was put on 10 mg daily and had been using for years. The last six months I experienced ""flushing""  in medical term and my doctor told me to stop this  for 28 days. The first 14 days I experienced ""flushing"" 2- 3 times the following 14 days I experienced maybe once. My Triglycerides, HDL and LDL are all  below the average and show normal from  laboratory report. I was told to stop taking this and want me to try me on 5 mg Crestor but always have more side effects. Debating on taking a different statin drug.Read More Read Less"
"Poison!  Not worth trying to lower cholesterol. I apparently tolerated Atorvastatin at 40mg for years. Then in November, 2020 doctor increased it to 80mg.  Within a week  I began burping constantly and developed GERD as never before. Feel awful and without conversation even doctor discontinued the Atorvastatin. Will never take another Statin. Recommend you read about these drugs before taking them. Foolishly, I never realized the side effects and adverse reaction risks with these drugs before ingesting them. I felt fine before being treated! Month later and still burping constantly. Real attractive! Read More Read Less"
I’m 30 been on this stuff a year I’m probably not got long left already have the heart of a 60 year old smoker lol
Very High LDL and HDL(good). Dr. prescribed 40 mg every day. No side effects so far after 1 month. Have changed my diet to a plan based whole food to see if this can work instead of Rx. Still some cream in my coffee but no other dairy. Hoping to heal my body naturally and get off this Rx.
"Well, it did lower my cholesterol, but within a couple of weeks of starting it I began seeing hair all over my pillow in the AM.  Now I have a crappy bald hairline and thinning hair.  Within a couple of weeks of discontinuing it my hair seems to have stopped falling out.  The best I can determine is that it MAY start growing back within 6 months and that it MAY come back on its own.  How nice!  Sorry, NO ONE will ever talk me into taking statins again.  I am a 72 yo female with NO family history of stroke or heart attack.  I will take my chances in the future.  Throw this garbage out!!Read More Read Less"
"I'm on 20mg QD and since I began taking this, I have had joint pain every day.  I couldn't figure out why it started (especially during summer months). Never had joint pain before.  Also, I wake up to leg cramps almost every other night.  Insomnia real bad.  My doctor put me on it for prevention of heart attack or stroke. I don't like to the side effects.  I have been losing weight (not from the meds) I started Keto way before this medication.  So, I do excercise regularly.  This stuff is not good will ask for lower dose, or get off completely.  It's not worth the joint pain, from a scale 1-10 joint pain is an ""8"".Read More Read Less"
"My doctor doesn't like the ratio between my HDL and LDL.  Even though my overall cholesteral is not high, the LDL level is.  I've had no issues with this drug and have been taking it for many years"
"Heart disease runs in my family. Even though I've been a strict vegetarian since 1973 and have been eating whole, organic foods, I had heart attack. My cardiologist said my heart damage was minimal.  I'm on 40 mg of atorvastatin.  It's the anti-inflammatory aspect of the drug that helps me, as my cholesterol was low all along.  I have arthritis (not from the drug) and I just feel more stiff upon arising in the morning; that stiffness dissipitates upon walking around a bit.  I'm happy with the drug so far.Read More Read Less"
"Every time I take this medicine it make my stomach blowed, gas, and sometimes nose bleed, muscle cramps is unbearable."
I am feeling terrible on them tired pains everything nasty
"I was on Atorvastatin 40 mg for about 60 days and then started having uncontrollable, severe nose bleeds.  After three trips to the ER, I demanded that my doctor switch me back to Simvastatin.  Beware of this drug!  Didn't work for me..."
After taking 80ml I started having neck pain and foggy brain my neck muscle was so tight I had migraine stopped taking it and my symptoms went away
"Began taking 80mg and started having cramps in my lower back and legs. Doctor wanted me to take half of the dosage for a week and see if that helped. Pain in my legs damn near unbearable, thinking  about not taking this medication any longer."
"It has lowered my colesteral, but the cramps and muscle spasms are terrible! Im about ready to stop taking it!"
"Three months of side effects - digestion issues, weight gain, muscle cramps and a constant soar throat.  Coming off the drug resulted in a further four weeks of awful stomach pains.  Reduced readings from 6.1 to 4.1 in three months, but not worth it for the side effects.  Will find a less intrusive solution."
"After being on 80mg of this drug for over 5 months, developed severe neck, back shoulder, arm pain. Starting seeing chiropractor for 2 wks. This didn't help at all. Went to dr. he put me on a steroid for the shoulder/arm pain. Start researching and looking for reviews to find others experiencing the same... Also leg and hip pain, burning sensation in arch of my feet.  Memory issues (foggy head), Ear ringing.  Just don't feel myself.  Stop taking the medicine about a week now. Shoulder pain some what better.  This drug is the devil!!!Read More Read Less"
"I have just had a terrible experience with Atorvastatin which I believe came about mostly because my Dr. prescribed a dose of this drug which was way to high.  FYI, PFZ advises a starting dose for lipitor of only 10-20 mg.  My TC initially was 201, tri 116,and LDL-c of 130.  These are all well within the normal range for mass tested healthy populations.  My Dr. (for what reason only god knows) started me at 80 mg of Atorvastatin.  Within weeks I felt terrible, achy, depressed, moody, forgetful etc.   I requested a new lipid test at one month.  The results frightened me.  TC of **86**, LDL of only ***27*** - OUCH.   What did my doctor say?  “Good job!  I think we can now lower the dose to 40mg.”  To this I said BYE doc!   I have now stopped taking the drug altogether because my research indicates that statins do little and are very risky in the long run. Common frightening complaints filed with the FDA are that statins raise the risk of diabetes, liver problems, muscle pains, and memory loss.  For those who wish to come up to speed on this, search for a meta study completed by 16 docs and researchers of 39 trials involving over 900,000 patients titled: “LDL-C does not cause cardiovascular disease:”  A real eye opener!     Most do not need this drug.  Visit the FDA adverse side effect database called FAERS to get a good side effect profile. And, if you must take this drug, start at the lowest dose possible. In most instances, 10 mg of Lipitor will lower the lipid profile into the desired range within three months. For more on this visit the FAERS (fda) database.  Cholesterol exists in every cell in our bodies for very good reasons and 30% of it resides in our brains. Going too low is very dangerous.  Mother nature gave us cholesterol for very good reasons.

Was on this drug for many years - 40 mg. one day 80 the next - developed after several years severe muscle spasms - when in the throes of a spasm could not do anything - severe pain and sweating profusely (drenched after a spasm).  Have stopped in the past year - now my cholesterol is sky high with my bad - really high - they want me to take repatha (previous heart attack) - don't know what to do.
"This has taken all my energy tired all day and night. I can get 8 up to 10 hours of sleep and wake up feeling totally exhausted wore-down, barely able to get out bed. It has affected my memory, and concentration and I have to research tax cases. I can be watching a program on tv and a commercial will come on and couldnâ??t I tell you what program I watching. I was taking Lipitor it was perfect my nature, personality, attitude, energy was excellent. Would wake able to get out of bed with energy, and not feeling like I havenâ??t slept in week or ran a marathon. This crap SUCKS. Also, this other substitute oval-shaped AVN 80 on one side and APO on the other side. Donâ??t take this it has the same affect. This is not helping when your are totally drained of energy. When something is working they take it away and experiment on us with these faulty drugs. Please report this drug and all the other substitute. Read More Read Less"
"Fast weight gain which seemed counter productive.  Itching but didn't realize till after I went off that it was probably due to the meds.  Went off as I was loosing my ability to concentrate, think and memory.  When doing research I decided to look up a particular item.  Turned around to type it and had no idea what I was doing.  Not like me so I checked out tthe meds and I fit several of the bad side effects.  Went off and within a week was getting back to normal."
"Leg, back pain, urine frequency, tinnitus, gerd and over all feel like I'm 100 years old."

"After about 1 week, my kidneys were painfully sore leaving  a severe pain across my lower back. Then screaming pain started shooting from my hips down both legs, through the bursa, the knee caps, lower legs to my feet every few seconds sending my feet into convulsions every few seconds from 8:00PM Saturday evening to 10:00 AM the next morning.  No Nsaids had any effect."
"After taking only 4 tablets I couldn’t have felt worse if I’d been poisoned.  Back pain, nausea, splitting headaches, fuzzy head and stomach pain.  I stopped them and I am still suffering side effects 3 days later."
"My doctor just prescribed Atorvastatin oral but now I see al these negative reviews, he's going to get blasted as this ""poison"" is injuring many people. I have never read of such horrible side effects from any drug unless it was designed to kill. I would never take this Throw it away."
"My doctor recently changed my prescription from 10mg to 20mg as my LDL jumped a little.  After about 8 days, I started noticing a 'warm' sensation in the back of my left thigh and now in my right buttock.  I never had these symptoms prior to the dosage increase and now I'm wondering if the Atorvastatin is the culprit.  Many colleagues and friends of mine are telling me to stop it altogether, but I've decided to just go back to my 10mg dosage to see if the symptoms stop.

I called my doctor and he said if it continues he wants me to come in, but I don't want to waste time or money going in only for him to tell me what I already suspect is the culprit.

Has anyone else experienced these types of symptoms?Read More Read Less"
"Atorvastatin caused severe muscle pain, especially in my legs to the point where getting off the couch or going up stairs was unbearable.  It caused GERD, rise in blood sugar nearly to diabetic levels, brain fog, and a general feeling of malaise.  I assertively yet kindly explained to my Doctor that I’d no longer be taking it. These symptoms still exist but I’m recently off the meds."

Please do your research on these killer drugs!"

Was prescribed Atorvastatin due to having high cholesterol levels and previously had heart attack at 51. They caused severe pain in joints and muscles which is a known side effect.

"I ceased taking 10mg generic atorvastatin after 24 days.  A bit over a week into taking it I had a never before experienced spasm almost like a semi-paralysis/extreme muscle weakness, travel down both legs to my feet.  The spasm passed, and I attributed it to possibly the result of a poor sleeping posture.  Then a few days later it happened twice again . . .same scenario.  I also now was left with a lingering feeling of weak muscles in my thighs and mild pain in both buttocks.  At this point it occurred to me to look up possible statin side effects.  This confirmed my spasms were in some way connected to the statin, and I immediately stopped.   My doctor agreed.  I am convinced my reaction was Statin Induced Piriformis Myopathy/Syndrome.  I had used ""Lipitor"" over ten years ago, and took COQ10 too, with no side effects at all.   So, I assumed beginning again would be no different.  I am now age 78 and female.
