FYI, PFZ advises a starting dose for lipitor of only 10-20 mg.  My TC initially was 201, tri 116,and LDL-c of 130.  These are all well within the normal range for mass tested healthy populations.  My Dr. (for what reason only god knows) started me at 80 mg of Atorvastatin.  Within weeks I felt terrible, achy, depressed, moody, forgetful etc.   I requested a new lipid test at one month.  The results frightened me.  TC of **86**, LDL of only ***27*** - OUCH.   What did my doctor say?  “Good job!  I think we can now lower the dose to 40mg.”  To this I said BYE doc!   I have now stopped taking the drug altogether because my research indicates that statins do little and are very risky in the long run. Common frightening complaints filed with the FDA are that statins raise the risk of diabetes, liver problems, muscle pains, and memory loss.  For those who wish to come up to speed on this, search for a meta study completed by 16 docs and researchers of 39 trials involving over 900,000 patients titled: “LDL-C does not cause cardiovascular disease:”  A real eye opener!     Most do not need this drug.  Visit the FDA adverse side effect database called FAERS to get a good side effect profile. And, if you must take this drug, start at the lowest dose possible. In most instances, 10 mg of Lipitor will lower the lipid profile into the desired range within three months. For more on this visit the FAERS (fda) database.

A bit over a week into taking it I had a never before experienced spasm almost like a semi-paralysis/extreme muscle weakness, travel down both legs to my feet.  The spasm passed, and I attributed it to possibly the result of a poor sleeping posture.  Then a few days later it happened twice again . . .same scenario.  I also now was left with a lingering feeling of weak muscles in my thighs and mild pain in both buttocks.  At this point it occurred to me to look up possible statin side effects.  This confirmed my spasms were in some way connected to the statin, and I immediately stopped.   My doctor agreed.  I am convinced my reaction was Statin Induced Piriformis Myopathy/Syndrome.  I had used ""Lipitor"" over ten years ago, and took COQ10 too, with no side effects at all.   So, I assumed beginning again would be no different.  I am now age 78 and female.  This could have been a negative for going back on a statin.  However, I will never go near any kind of statin again.Read More Read Less",Overall rating 2.0,Mar |,9/4/2021,Patient,Female |,75 or over |,1,https://reviews.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-841-atorvastatin-oral
